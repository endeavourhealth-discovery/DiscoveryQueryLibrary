# Discovery Query Library
A public repository to store and share useful SQL scripts, value/code sets, project data sets or anything else 
related to building reporting services with the Discovery Data Service project.

The idea behind this is that everyone contributes to this making it a useful resource to be able to get up and 
running quickly.  

Please add comments or readme files to any scripts or directories so other people will 
be able to understand exactly what each resource does.
