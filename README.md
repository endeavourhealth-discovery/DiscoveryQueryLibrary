# Discovery Query Library
A public repository to store and share useful SQL scripts, value sets or anything else 
related to the Discovery project.

The idea behind this is that everyone contributes to this making it a useful resource to be able to get up and 
running quickly.  

Please add comments or readme files to any scripts or directories so other people will 
be able to understand exactly what each resource does.
